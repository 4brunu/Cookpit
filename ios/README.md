# Cookpit
Flickr API implementation for iOS with C++ core

## Requirement
* Xcode
* [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for dependency management

## Installation
* Run `make ios` at root folder
* Install iOS dependencies (do one of the following)
  * Run `carthage update --platform iOS` read `Cartfile`, rebuild dependency resolver, re-write Cartfile.resolved and fetch dependencies
  * Run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS` read `Cartfile.resolved` and build previously listed version there

## Building
* Open Cookpit.xcworkspace to develop iOS app

## Bridging Code
* `objc_gen/` contains all bridging code in Objective-C++ generated by djinni's interface files in `djinni/`
* `cookpit.xcodeproj` and `vendors/` are products from gyp which generating library projects for iOS app to use

## Architecture
* MVVM - Model(M) is sharing between iOS and Android with C++ code. VM(View Model) is a class on Swift provide necessary data for application to render. V (View) is purely on iOS with Swift. V and VM are glued together with reactive paradigm in this project we use [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/).
